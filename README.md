# Solutions to ALP I Exercises

In 2011/12 I took the course [ALP
I](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS11/ALP1/) (algorithms and
programming 1), which was mostly about functional programming and
Haskell. I didn't dislike functional programming back then, but I didn't
appreciate it either.  Things change. Anyway, these are my solutions to
some of the exercises.
